# What's this?

This is a practice project to get familiar with Rust. The code is based on [this FreeCodeCamp video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsocPEZBd-M).

# What does the code do?

The code takes in two numbers and an operator (an expression of the form `2 x 9`) and outputs the result (of the form `3 / 4 = 0.75`).

The video is an amazing resource, just like the rest of FreeCodeCamp. Highly recommended.
